###Graph Algorithms Community Detection



With apoc.periodic.iterate you provide 2 statements, the first outer statement is providing a stream of values to be processed. The second, inner statement processes one element at a time or with iterateList:true the whole batch at a time.

We can use following query to create a weighted undirected hero social graph.

CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
"MATCH (p1:Hero)-->(:Comic)<--(p2:Hero) where id(p1) < id(p2) RETURN p1,p2",
"MERGE (p1)-[r:KNOWS]-(p2) ON CREATE SET r.weight = 1 ON MATCH SET r.weight = r.weight + 1"
, {batchSize:5000, parallel:false,iterateList:true})





###Graph projection

Neo4j graph algorithms support two ways of loading subset of the graph, as a virtual graph to quickly run the algorithms on.  First one is known as label and relationship-type loading, where we load nodes by labels and relationships by their types.
